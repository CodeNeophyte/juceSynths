# Simple Juce & Maximilian VSTs.
Here is a self contained set of vsts designed to be extendable.

Although unfinished, there will be the following shortly:
- Empty project for quick VST writing.
- Additive / Subtractive Synthesiser.
- Frequency Modulation Synthesiser.
- Granular Synthesiser.

Building this should be straightforward on any machine because Juce takes care of the different platforms very well. Drop an issue if you need help. Essentially just navigate to the necessary project, then into builds, and for MacOS there will be an Xcode project and Linux there will be a makefile or QtCreator project. If you are using Windows bow your head in shame and use the VS files.
